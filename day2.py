"""Creating a Comment
Comments starts with a #, and Python will ignore them:"""
#This is a comment
print("Welcome To tech_nest")

#Example
print("Hello, World!") #This is a comment 
"""Comments can be placed at the end of a line, and Python will ignore the rest of the line:"""

#print("Hello, World!")
print("Cheers, Mate!") 
"""A comment does not have to be text that explains the code, it can also be used to prevent Python from executing code:"""

#Multiline Comments
"""Python does not really have a syntax for multiline comments.
To add a multiline comment you could insert a # for each line:"""
#This is a comment
#written in
#more than just one line
print("Hope U understood the concept of commnets")

"""Or, not quite as intended, you can use a multiline string.
Since Python will ignore string literals that are not assigned to a variable, you can add a multiline string (triple quotes) in your code, and place your comment inside it:"""

#Example
"""
This is a comment
written in
more than just one line
